         I am Raimond and this is my first time using Next.JS, GitHub and Vercel.

        <p style="text-align: center;"> 
          I recently graduated with a degree in Electrical engineering and 
          realize that I enjoy software and the world of coding. I mainly code
          microcontrollers but it is time for a new challange. I enjoy learning 
          new and useful skills.

          SovTech strikes me as forward thinkers. They know that software is an 
          ever changing and evolving field and thus invests time and resources into
          graduates to help the company thrive. Sovtech not only has an impressive track 
          record but they continue to thrive and optimize their costumers business.
          It is clear from reading case studies and blogs that SovTech has a team of
          highly innovative thinkers. It would be an honour to learn from them and to 
          learn and work with peers in such an environment.

          I know that I can do anything if I set my mind to it. I firmly belive in the quote " You miss every shot you don't take"
          I always make sure to deliver projects to the best of my ability and analyze what could have been optimatized for future 
          endeavours. I believe that with the right training, I can trhive and add value to any project that is assigned to me or a 
          team that I am apart of. I do not shy away from leader positions but can also assume a subordinate position when required.
